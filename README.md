# Grass-Germination
Cleaned weather data with SQL then manipulated and visualized it with grass data in Microsoft Excel  
to determine the best time to plant grass seed.  

## Took a messy table from 105,298 rows and 30 columns to 732 rows and 16 columns using MySQL Workbench.
  - Data was weather conditions at March Air Force Base (close proximity to my house)
  - Each observation (row) was taken 3 minutes apart
  - I took the last 10 years of data
  - Data was cleaned, grouped, sorted, and filtered into a usable data frame that I could use in Excel

## Further manipulated the data to create a dashboard in Microsoft Excel
  - Created helper columns and new sheets to get my data for my charts
  - Added in grass seed germination data
  - Combined charts to create interactive graphs of temperature, dew point, humidity, and wind speed
  - Created dashboards to see all the data with live updating graphs that can have the date range and grass type selected
